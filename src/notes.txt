some notes for the class Practical Machine Learning

1. definition of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value,etc.
           Ground Truth
            +    -  
     +      TP   FP
test 
     -      FN   TN

sensitvity=Pr(positive test|disease)=TP/(TP+FN)
specificity=Pr(neative test|no disease)=TN/(FP+TN)
positive predictive value=Pr(disease|positive test)=TP/(TP+FP)
negative predictive value=Pr(no disease|negative test)=TN/(FN+TN)
accuracy=Pr(correct outcome)=(TP+TN)/(TP+FP+TN+FN)


2. rules of thumb of study design
   for large data size: 60% training, 20% testing, 20% validation
   for medium data size: 60% training, 40% testing
   for small data size: cross validation

   cross valiadation
   -random subsampling without replacement
   -random subsampling with replacement=bootstrapping
   -K-fold: divide into K equal nonoverlapping subsets and use one as testing the 
            others as training. 
            large K=less bias, more variance
            small K=more bias, less variance
